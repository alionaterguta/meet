## Project Description

The Meet app is a progressive web application with a serverless backend,
offering offline access to upcoming events in specific cities. Its responsive design
ensures seamless display across devices, delivering a superior user experience.
Powered by Test-Driven Development, it prioritizes code quality and test coverage for optimal performance.

### User Stories

1. As a user,
I should be able to filter events by city
So that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

2. As a user,
I should be able to show and hide events details
can have control over the amount of information displayed.

3. As a user,
I should be able to see a specific number of events,
so can I can quickly find and browse through a list of events without being
 overwhelmed by too much information.

4. As a user,
I should be able to use the App when offline,
so that I have the Events list and info related to them at all times. 

5. As a user,
I should be able to add a shortcut to the home screen,
so that I have easy access to the app.

6. As a user,
I should be able to see charts visualizing event details,
so that I would better understand the data associated with events and make a choise.
